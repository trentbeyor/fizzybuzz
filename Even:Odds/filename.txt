In my early years, I was very influenced by the omnipresence of electronic music in Barcelona. Working for multiple DJs and clubs, I found a canvas to explore the boundaries of graphic design and expression. This is where I developed an awareness of the crucial importance of the communication aspect of design. My studio space at this time was in my father\u0092s architecture studio. There I found a love for architecture which strongly influenced me and brought an inherent order to my design work.\n\nThis geeky passion for organizing information found its home in New York.\n\nMy U.S. career began with AR Media, working under the guidance of Michael Ian Kaye. He instilled in me a respect for design and typography as art forms and his dedication continues to inspire me every day.\nThirteen  years later, I continue to work on print design, but now I focus on interaction design. As Co-Founder and Head of Design at Behance\u0097a company dedicated to organizing the creative world, I led the brand identity and design of all Behance products\u0096 including the Behance Network, ProSite, The 99U Conference & Magazine, and Action Method, amongst others.\n\nMy work has earned a Type Director\u0092s Award and several Webby nominations and honoree awards, as well as the distinction of being named finalist at the SXSW Interactive Awards for two years running.\n\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097"},"features":[{"projects":[{"id":12139157,"featured_on":1396281602}],"site":{"id":1,"name":"Behance.net","key":"net","icon":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/site\/favicon.ico","url":"http:\/\/www.behance.net","domain":"www.behance.net","ribbon":{"image":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/ribbons\/1x\/network.png","image_2x":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/ribbons\/2x\/network@2x.png"}}},{"projects":[{"id":413783,"featured_on":1353848404},{"id":519495,"featured_on":1353722404},{"id":1797822,"featured_on":1353571203},{"id":2812719,"featured_on":1354226403},{"id":3750163,"featured_on":1353470403},{"id":3872017,"featured_on":1353142803},{"id":3856261,"featured_on":1353294003},{"id":5287059,"featured_on":1350331202}],"site":{"id":125,"name":"Pantone Canvas Gallery","key":"pantone","icon":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/square\/1x\/pantone.png?cb=264615658","url":"http:\/\/canvas.pantone.com","domain":"canvas.pantone.com","network_id":31,"ribbon":{"image":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/ribbons\/1x\/pantone.png?cb=264615658","image_2x":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/ribbons\/2x\/pantone@2x.png?cb=264615658"}},"num_of_projects":8},{"projects":[{"id":22886287,"featured_on":1426993202}],"site":{"id":113,"name":"SCAD Portfolios","key":"scad","icon":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/square\/1x\/scad.png?cb=264615658","url":"http:\/\/portfolios.scad.edu","domain":"portfolios.scad.edu","network_id":21,"ribbon":{"image":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/ribbons\/1x\/scad.png?cb=264615658","image_2x":"https:\/\/a5.behance.net\/18a38a3e2ed59ee40aecb4241a773daf8ee37d06\/img\/galleries\/icons\/ribbons\/2x\/scad@2x.png?cb=264615658"}}}],"social_links":[{"social_id":8,"url":"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/matias_corea","service_name":"Pinterest","value":"matias_corea"},{"social_id":1,"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/matiascorea","service_name":"Twitter","value":"matiascorea"},{"social_id":2,"url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/matiascoreaNY","service_name":"Facebook","value":"matiascoreaNY"},{"social_id":9,"url":"http:\/\/matiascorea.tumblr.com","service_name":"Tumblr","value":"matiascorea"},{"social_id":4,"url":"http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/matiascorea","service_name":"LinkedIn","value":"in\/matiascorea"}]},"http_code":200});
